7. Fan Engagement and Rewards
How to make smart contracts work on behalf of creators is a fun challenge of the Web3 economy, as they’re sure to create new monetization opportunities. Companies that manage bands, games, and online creators will deploy blockchain technology to bring accountability to streaming and create stickiness with fans.  

An artist may issue a piece of their work as a non-fungible token (NFTs) that can be sold on a secondary market. When new transactions occur, a smart contract can programmatically pay royalties back to the original creator ensuring they share in the increased value of their work.
